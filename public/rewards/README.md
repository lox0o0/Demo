# Rewards Page Background Assets

## Background Image
Save your rewards page background image here:
- **File path:** `public/rewards/background.webp` (or `.jpg`, `.png`)
- **Recommended format:** WebP for best compression, or JPG for compatibility
- **Recommended resolution:** 1920x1080 or higher
- **File size:** Optimize to under 1MB for fast loading

## Usage
The background will be applied to the Rewards page with appropriate dark overlays for content readability.

## Current Setup
The Rewards page currently uses `/locker-room/background.webp` as its background image. To use a rewards-specific background, update the image path in `components/Rewards.tsx` to `/rewards/background.webp`.
