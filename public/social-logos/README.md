# Social Media Logos

Place your social media logo files here with the following naming convention:

- `facebook.png` (or `.svg`)
- `tiktok.svg` (or `.png`)
- `instagram.png` (or `.svg`)
- `x.svg` (or `.png`) - for X (formerly Twitter)

**Note:** You can use either `.svg` or `.png` files. Just make sure the filename matches exactly (case-sensitive).

**File formats:**
- SVG files are preferred for scalability
- PNG files work well too, especially if they have transparent backgrounds
- Make sure logos are high quality and properly sized
